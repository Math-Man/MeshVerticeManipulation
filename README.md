# Mesh Vertice Manipulation Scriptset

Please note that this project is highly indev and currently only cpu based. Although its pretty fast, I am planning to carry my changes to a computeshader script later on.

A set of Unity component scripts for ease of mesh manipulation has several example scripts.


Primary component that enables mesh vertice manipulation file is "ParticleBasedMeshResolver.cs"
"ClothApplicator.cs" creates very basic and primitive cloth physics implementation without colliders. due to the approach taken, this script can be applied to any imported mesh alonside the resolver to generate cloth physics contraint behaviour
"MakeCircle.cs" is a showcase of a solution for a common question where a plane mesh is converted to a circle.
"SpringWobble.cs" is currently unfinished
